# yw-web-component-demos
This repo records experiments and demonstrations of the YesWorkflow Web Component Library and sample web application developed as part of a Gonzaga University senior design project.

The web components can be found in the GitHub repo https://github.com/aniehuser/senior-design-group10.

A staging instance of a complete web application is hosted at http://workflow-web.gonzaga.edu/.

The fork of the yw-prototypes repo hosting the modified version of YesWorkflow that can upload workflows and runs to the web application is at https://github.com/aniehuser/yw-prototypes.

Issues with any of these products may be reported at https://github.com/aniehuser/senior-design-group10/issues.
